There's currently a bug that crashes the game when using the older version of this mod.

Workaround:
1. Remove the northstar_client_localisation_japanese.txt file from Translation.JPtoEN/mods/resources
2. Backup your northstar_client_localisation_japanese.txt inside Northstar.Client/mods/resources
3. Replace your northstar_client_localisation_japanese.txt with the northstar_client_localisation_english.txt.

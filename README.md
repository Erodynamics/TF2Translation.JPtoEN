# TF2Translation.JPtoEN
Translates the Japanese UI to English. Some multiplayer elements cannot be translated as those changes would need to be done server side. USE WITH JAPANESE TITANFALL 2, THIS MOD DOES NOT COME WITH JAPANESE VOICE OVERS.

Installation instructions

Using Prepacked:
1. Change your language to Japanese.
  For Steam, this can be done through Properties > Language
  For Origin, this can be done through Game Properties > Advanced Launch Options > Game Language
2. Drag and drop the items inside TF2Translation.JPtoEN/prepack/vpk into your Titanfall 2/vpk folder.
3. Place the patcher.bat file inside the main folder of your game and run the batch file.

This process is reversable by deleting englishclient_frontend.bsp.pak000_dir.vpk, running the patcher again and selecting uninstall.

If any other modifications have been done to the englishclient_frontend file, they may not work. Please create your own VPK using the files provided inside the TF2Translation.JPtoEN/mod folder.
